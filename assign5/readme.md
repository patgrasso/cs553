# Homework 5
This homework is all about building a decision tree classifier around extracted
textual features.

## Dependencies
This project runs with python 3.x and requires
[scikit](http://scikit-learn.org),
[scipy](http://scipy.org),
[numpy](http://numpy.org),
[pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org),
[nltk](http://nltk.org), and
[gensim](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim).
Fortunately, these can be easily installed with pip:

```
pip install -U scikit-learn scipy numpy pandas nltk gensim
```

Again, make sure these dependencies are installed with the correct python
version. Try checking the output of `python --version` and make sure it reads
`Python 3.x.x`.

## Running
Once all of the dependencies have been installed, simply run any of
`decision-tree.py`, `topic-node.py`, or `nltk-tree.py` with python (3+). The
NLTK decision tree takes a little while longer to train, so watch a youtube
video or something to pass the 4-5 minutes it will take.

## tficf.py
We had experimented with creating a vectorizer that weighs terms based on their
relevance to the class being predicted (term frequency inverse class frequency).
`tficf.py` is the result of that. It barely works and is not used in the
homework, so it can thus be ignored.

## printtree.py
This contains a function to print the tree generated by scikit's decision tree
classifier. It too is unused as the tree is automatically saved to `tree.dot`
upon execution, which can later be converted into a PNG image by running

```
dot -Tpng tree.dot -o tree.png
```
